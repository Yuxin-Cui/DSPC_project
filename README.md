There are 537 million adult patients who have diabetes (approximately 1 in 10) ranging from 20 to 79 years old globally. The annual diabetic-related deaths are estimated to be 6.7 million. The incidences of diabetes are still rising, which makes the diabetes-related social-economic burdens tremendous. There is an unmet need for early diagnosis or prevention of diabetes, in particular Type 2 (unable to make sufficient insulin or the insulin doesnâ€™t work properly). The advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms and tools could provide a promising strategy for us to predict the onset of diabetes earlier. 

In this project, I attempted to predict the outcome of diabetes based on the medical records of clinicopathological features. The raw data, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, were obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. The dataset contains one target variable (Outcome) and several predictor variables such as pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, etc. 

Several selected ML algorithms and one automated ML approach were trained and deployed for their prediction accuracy. The predictions of different modelling approaches were compared in terms of their accuracies. The algorithms of Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Machines are superior to others.  The limitation and possible improvements in the future were discussed as well.
